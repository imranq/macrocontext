## MacroContext

Its hard to understand what companies do without resorting to sensational headlines and getting only a small fraction of information. With graph theory, textual analysis, and economic indicators, we can create a "corporate graph" that uses news and analytics to map out the world one company at a time.

Things to do:
- Conglomerate economic indicators and data into a central database 
- Stream news through various APIs
- Perform textual analysis on news items to find likelihood of different pieces of the economy 
- Have an awesome UI that maps companies and their macrocontext (starting with industrial companies like Alcoa first) in one search
