# MacroContext
## *Economics Visualized*

Its hard to understand what companies do without resorting to sensational headlines and getting only a small fraction of information. With graph theory, textual analysis, and economic indicators, we can create a "corporate graph" that uses news and analytics to map out the world one company at a time.

MacroContext allows you to see economic indicators combined with several data sources such as corresponding news, differing viewpoints, and more.
